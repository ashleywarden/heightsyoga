                            <p>I work inclusively with people from all walks of life, all genders, sexual orientations, cultures and spiritual backgrounds. 
                              I hold a Master's degree in Counselling Psychology, and a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and Counselling and Human Development.</p>

                              I work inclusively with people from all walks of life, all genders, sexual orientations, cultures and spiritual backgrounds. I hold a Master's degree in Counselling Psychology, and a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and Counselling and Human Development.
                                I grew up within the Lower Mainland of Vancouver and feel grateful to still call the region home.  I especially enjoy spending time hiking, travelling, and exploring this beautiful province with my partner and our dog.<br><br>
                                I have experience working within post-secondary and private practise settings. This has provided me the opportunity and privilege of working with a diverse range of people of all ages on challenges such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, perfectionism, stress, suicidal ideation, trauma, family and relationship difficulties, and life direction concerns.<br><br>
                                In my counselling session, I integrate a unique blend of complementary therapeutic modalities: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Person-Centred, Solution-focused Therapy, and Somatic Therapy.  My goal when we meet is to provide you with a sense of understanding, compassion, and warmth.<br><br>
                                Together we can collaborate and explore your life experiences, explore whether you would like to make some changes, and work together to implement strategies that work for you. I work inclusively with all populations, and my approach is also trauma, culturally, and spiritually informed. In my perspective, therapy is a unique experience and journey. My role on this journey is to act as a guide and engage with you in a way that is safe and helps you move in the direction of your desired outcomes.

                              our stories and instead moves into our body, reconnecting us to ourselves, our experience that are residing within our 
                              physical presence, allowing us to let go of old trauma, and release suppressed emotions.
